# Clustering generates binary labels from subjective experience data 

The folder contains the clustering script used to generate Mystical, Visual and Anxious experience labels. The script implements clustering of Mystical experiences from Total MEQ score across datasets. The same script is used to generate labels for other subjective experience categories with the following changes: 

1. Update to relevant directory
2. Update variable names to relevant experience
3. Update figure axes and titles

The result of this script is a Matlab table with two columns (1: Subject ID; 2: Binary experience classification) and visualisation of clustering results and data distribution.
